Task overview: 
For this task, it was an exercise to create a localization & mapping methodology for robotic navigation & mapping by using the Turtlebot3 platform
gazebo simulation & Rviz application and that would gives us the visualization of the Robot the movements with using SLAM approach. 

Before starting, make sure these applications are already installed; ROS, Rviz, and gazebo.

In order to have successful simulation and setp by step instructions for saving the final view of the G-map, 
at the begining visited the website below; 
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/ Open the Ubuntu 18.04 terminal and copied the following commands.


HINT#1: open a new termenal for the master node by typing in the command ($ roscore) 

-- From the left side tap for (PC SET-UP) -- 
FIRST GO TO: 
3. Quick Start Guide> 3.1 PC Setup from very top, before copying and pasting, check model of your system if its, kinetic or other versions,
maine is Melodic, so cleck on your downloaded verion.

THEN GO TO: 
3. 1. 2. Install ROS 1 on Remote PC - cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
3. 1. 3. Install Dependent ROS 1 Packages, - cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
3. 1. 4. Install TurtleBot3 Packages, - cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
LASTLY GO TO: 
3. 1. 5. Set TurtleBot3 Model Name, - cope & paste the command to the treminal and choose the preffered model (TurtleBot3 Burger OR TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi)


HINT#2: open onther new termenal for the GAZEBO SIMULATION - node

-- From the left side tap for (GAZEBO SIMULATION) --
FIRST GO TO: 
6. SIMULATION > 6.1 Gazebo Simulation, before copying and pasting, check model of your system if its, kinetic or other versions,
maine is Melodic, so cleck on your downloaded verion.

THEN GO TO: 
6. 1. 1. Install Simulation Package - cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
6. 1. 2. Launch Simulation World - cope & paste the commands to the terminal of the (TurtleBot3 World)
LASTLY GO TO: 
6. 1. 3. Operate TurtleBot3  - cope & paste the commands to the terminal to run it

HINT#3: open onther new termenal for the SLAM SIMULATION - node

-- From the left side tap for (SLAM SIMULATION) --
FIST GO TO: 
6. SIMULATION > 6.2 SLAM Simulation, before copying and pasting, check model of your system if its, kinetic or other versions,
maine is Melodic, so cleck on your downloaded verion.

THEN GO TO: 
6. 2. 1.Launch Simulation World, - cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
6. 2. 2. Run SLAM Node - cope & paste the commands to the terminal

HINT#4: open onther new termenal for the Teleoperation - node
LASTLY GO TO: 
6. 2. 3. Run Teleoperation Node, - cope & paste the commands to the terminal to run it.

HINT#5: use you keyboard to control your TurtleBot3!
 ---------------------------
 Moving around:
        w
   a    s    d
        x

 w/x : increase/decrease linear velocity
 a/d : increase/decrease angular velocity
 space key, s : force stop


ENJOY YOUR TOUR AROUND THE AREA!!!

After the Robor finally discovered the whole map successfully, you could just save your G-MAP by using this command ($ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map)
 If you would like to quit just hit (CTRL-C) in the terminal to cancel this mission.
 
In conclusion, if you would like to view the may you have created, 

GO TO,
Files> Home> then you will find the G-Map file named as (map.pgm)

Thank you for following my instructions, I hope you have learned something enjoyed it!

Best Regards,
Abdullah
