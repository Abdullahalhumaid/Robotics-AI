Task overview: 
For this task, it was an exercise to create a localization & mapping methodology for robotic navigation & mapping by using the Turtlebot3 platform
gazebo simulation & Rviz application and that would gives us the visualization of the Robot the movements with using SLAM approach. 

After installing the required software applications including; ROS, Rviz, & gazebo. 

In order to have successful simulation and setp by step instructions for saving the final view of the G-map, 
at the begining visited the website below; 
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/ Open the Ubuntu 18.04 terminal and copied the following commands.

From the left side tap for (PC SET-UP)
GO TO: 
3. Quick Start Guide> 3.1 PC Setup from very top, before copying and pasting, check model of your system if its, kinetic or other versions,
maine is Melodic, so cleck on your downloaded verion.

THEN GO TO: 
3. 1. 2. Install ROS 1 on Remote PC and cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
3. 1. 3. Install Dependent ROS 1 Packages, and cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
3. 1. 4. Install TurtleBot3 Packages, and cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
LASTLY GO TO: 
3. 1. 5. Set TurtleBot3 Model Name, and cope & paste the command to the treminal and choose the preffered model (TurtleBot3 Burger OR TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi)


From the left side tap for (GAZEBO SIMULATION)
GO TO: 
6. SIMULATION > Gazebo Simulation, before copying and pasting, check model of your system if its, kinetic or other versions,
maine is Melodic, so cleck on your downloaded verion.

THEN GO TO: 
6. 1. 1. Install Simulation Package and cope & paste the commands to the terminal 
THEN GO TO: 
6. 1. 2. Launch Simulation World and cope & paste the commands to the terminal of the (TurtleBot3 World)
LASTLY GO TO: 
6. 1. 3. Operate TurtleBot3  and cope & paste the commands to the terminal to run it
